Multiplayer Save States

Place your multiplayer save states in the numbered subfolders:

states/multiplayer/2/GoldenEye 007 (U).state0  - For 2-player matches
states/multiplayer/3/GoldenEye 007 (U).state0  - For 3-player matches
states/multiplayer/4/GoldenEye 007 (U).state0  - For 4-player matches

To create these states:
1. Start GoldenEye in RetroArch
2. Set up multiplayer with desired player count
3. Press F2 to save to slot 0
4. Copy the state file from:
   ~/Library/Application Support/RetroArch/states/GoldenEye 007 (U).state0
5. Paste it into the appropriate folder (2, 3, or 4)

The UI will show radio buttons to select player count when loading multiplayer.
